This tool, called basem, brings semaphor functionality to the
shell. It has a very simple CLI described in the function usage().
Semaphores can be created as well as destroyed and the common Operations (p and v)
are usable by specifying the -p or -v flag. The Semaphores are referenced
by the Sys-V IPC keys.
